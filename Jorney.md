# My Journey from Pharma to IT

I graduated in pharmacy in 2021, but after graduation, I realized pharmacy wasn't my true calling. So, I decided to switch to the IT field. In 2022, I completed a data science course from Upgrad, where I learned about various subjects such as SQL, Python, Excel, NumPy, Pandas, and more.

During this time, I applied for many jobs and attended several interviews. Although I made it to the final round in some interviews, I could not secure a position. This made me realize I needed to improve my aptitude and reasoning skills.

I began learning aptitude from YouTube sources, focusing on problems like time and work, speed-time-distance, and more. Additionally, I applied for government jobs, including state-level CGL and CHSL, and banking exams, which often included aptitude-related questions in the first round.

Even though I didn't clear any of these exams, I saw significant improvement in my aptitude skills. This entire process took another year, and in 2023, I dedicated my time to preparing for government exams.

Although I haven't achieved employment yet, I have made substantial progress in my skills and knowledge. Now, I want to summarize all that I have learned, including my pharmacy skills, data science expertise, and aptitude problem-solving abilities, into this portfolio. This will help demonstrate to recruiters that I am a strong candidate ready to contribute effectively.
